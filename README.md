I LIke to play soccer alot and hang out with my friends. for example, go to movies and parties. I love cs classes even though sometimes it takes alot of time for me to understand small things in coding, but it is really fun and it pay off in the end when you learn something that alot of body have no idea about. Also, I like to travel alot I went to more than 14 counteries so far.
